      "The Moscone Center is the centerpiece of a vibrant neighborhood that includes major hotels, numerous cultural venues, restaurants, galleries and parks. More than two-thirds of the city’s 34,000 hotel rooms are within walking distance of The Moscone Center.\n",
      "All events at The Moscone Center are booked by San Francisco Travel Association. You may submit an RFP here and someone will reply to you.  If you have general questions about holding an event at The Moscone Center please contact their Convention Sales Department.\n",
      "The process begins with submitting the RFP form . One of San Francisco Travel Association’s  knowledgeable Convention Sales staff will work with you to determine the best space to host your event. Please note that The Moscone Center serves primarily to fill hotel rooms in San Francisco and potentially the surrounding area. For this reason, we offer availability to and subsequently contract with conventions and tradeshows that draw attendees from outside of the area.\n",
      "Once space has been offered you’ll work with our experienced Contracting Department to complete the license agreement. After the license agreement is signed one of our talented Event Managers will work with you and your vendors throughout the planning process and on-site to bring your ideas to life.\n",
