Here is a poem about cats:

Cats are mysterious and sleek,
Independent, they come and go as they seek.

With a mind of their own, they choose when to play,
A graceful hunter, stalking their prey.

A playful pounce, a batting spree,
Chasing a toy with glee.

Curled on your lap, a comforting purr,
A furry friend, always there.

Cats are wonderful creatures, indeed.
A perfect companion, fulfilling every need.
