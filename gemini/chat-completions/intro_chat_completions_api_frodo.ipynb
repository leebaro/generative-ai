Here's a breakdown:\\n\\n*   **Sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere:** Sunlight is composed of all the colors of the rainbow.\\n\\n*   **Scattering by air molecules:** When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen). This collision causes the light to scatter in different directions.\\n\\n*   **Wavelength and scattering:** The amount of scattering depends on the wavelength of the light. Shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered much more strongly than longer wavelengths (red and orange).\\n\\n*   **Why blue, not violet?** While violet light is scattered even more than blue, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light. Additionally, the sun emits slightly less violet light than blue, and the upper atmosphere absorbs some of the violet light.
